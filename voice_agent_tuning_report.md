# Voice Agent Endpointing & Speech Pipeline Evaluation

## 1. Endpointing Delay Tuning (VAD-Based)

| Test ID | min_delay (s) | max_delay (s) | Expected Impact                                      |
|---------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| V1      | 0.2            | 3.0            | Very fast; may interrupt user mid-sentence            |
| V2      | 0.5            | 3.0            | Quicker response, but still risk of cutting           |
| V3      | 1.0            | 3.0            | Balanced, fewer interruptions                         |
| V4      | 2.0            | 3.0            | More natural pauses but higher latency                |
| V5      | 0.5            | 6.0            | Quicker start, but longer max wait                    |
| V6      | 1.0            | 6.0            | Natural pacing, may miss over-pauses                 |

## 2. STT-Based Turn Detection (Deepgram)

| Test ID | Confidence Threshold | Silence (confident) | Max Silence | Expected Impact                                         |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| S1      | 0.9                  | 0.5 s               | 2.0 s        | Precise, but can miss due to high confidence requirement|
| S2      | 0.8                  | 0.3 s               | 2.0 s        | Responsive, low latency                                |
| S3      | 0.7                  | 0.3 s               | 2.0 s        | Very fast, risk of false triggers                      |
| S4      | 0.75                 | 0.35 s              | 2.0 s        | Balanced latency and false positives                   |
| S5      | 0.6                  | 0.2 s               | 1.5 s        | Ultra fast, but least stable                           |
| S6      | 0.85                 | 0.6 s               | 3.0 s        | Stable, natural but may delay                          |
| S7      | 0.8                  | 0.4 s               | 2.5 s        | Mid-level responsiveness, likely optimal               |

## 3. MultilingualModel Turn Detector

| Scenario                | Result                                   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "I think..." pause test | Waits naturally before responding        |
| Long reflective pause   | No early cut-off observed                |
| Responsiveness          | Slightly slower but very natural         |
| Best Use Case           | Multi-lingual and nuanced pacing         |

## 4. Streaming STT (Partial Hypotheses)

| Metric                  | Result                                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| LLM latency (partial)   | 400â€“600ms faster start                     |
| Final vs partial drift  | Minor hallucination if cutoff early        |
| Subjective accuracy     | Best when confidence > 0.8                |

| Speech Quality (MOS)      | 3.5/5               | 4.5/5                             |
| Natural Conversationality | Average             | Excellent                         |
